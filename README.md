# Ismail Ouaiahou
I was born in Marrakech Morocco. At the age of 11 years old I moved to South Korea and enrolled at an international school while I was working. 

## Work Experience 
I have worked as an actor, English teacher and did some modeling as well.

## My goal as a DCI student
My goal as a student in DCI is to be able to do what I love and what I have always wanted to do which is coding. 

## Why coding you say
Well I guess I am just a hippy at heart and always wanted to travel and live that nomadic life style, but also be able to earn a living as well.

## My hobbies 

I love reading, writing, skating, surfing, football playing and not watching because I like to do more than watch. I also love photography and video creating, boxing and kick boxing. And last but not least I love traveling.

## Life goals 
Love and accept this life I was given as a human being and live it to the fullest.
